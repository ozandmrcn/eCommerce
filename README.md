# eCommerce
Welcome to the **eCommerce** project! This is a frontend-only e-commerce site called **COSTY**, where all the data is stored in local storage. Users can add products to their cart, view the cart, and update quantities or remove products from the cart. The cart icon on the top-left corner updates dynamically as the user adds or removes items.
